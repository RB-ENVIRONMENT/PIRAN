"""
The `gauss` module provides a class for representing and evaluating
truncated Gaussian distributions.

This module defines the `Gaussian` class, which allows users to create
Gaussian distributions with specified lower and upper cutoffs. The
`eval` method of the `Gaussian` class can then be used to evaluate
the distribution at given locations.
"""

import numpy as np


class Gaussian:
    """
    Implements a truncated Gaussian distribution.

    The distribution is defined as:

    .. math::
        f(x) = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{(x - \\mu)^2}{\\sigma^2}\\right)

    for :math:`\\text{lower} \\le x \\le \\text{upper}`, and :math:`f(x) = 0` otherwise.
    Note that this is not normalised.

    Parameters
    ----------
    lower : float
        The lower cutoff; values of *x* below this are treated as having zero probability.
    upper : float
        The upper cutoff; values of *x* above this are treated as having zero probability.
    peak : float
        The mean (:math:`\\mu`) or expectation of the distribution.
    width : float
        The standard deviation (:math:`\\sigma`) of the distribution.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> X_min = 0.0
    >>> X_max = 1.0
    >>> X_m = 0.0
    >>> X_w = 0.577
    >>> gaussian = Gaussian(X_min, X_max, X_m, X_w)

        Evaluate the Gaussian distribution at the given locations.

        Parameters
        ----------
        X : np.ndarray
            The location(s) at which to evaluate the distribution.

        Returns
        -------
        np.ndarray
