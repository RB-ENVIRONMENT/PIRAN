        Produce polynomials in omega, which can be used to "piece-together" the larger
        CPDR.

        The CPDR in it's 'standard' form is a multivariate polynomial, given by

        .. math::
           A(X, \omega) \mu^4 - B(X, \omega) \mu^2 + C(X, \omega) = 0

        where mu = ck/w, and

        .. math::
           A(X, \omega) = SX^2 + P
           B(X, \omega) = RLX^2 + PS(2 + X^2)
           C(X, \omega) = PRL(1 + X^2)

        In particular, it is:

        - Quadratic in X
        - Biquadratic in k
        - Not a polynomial in omega

        Glauert & Horne 2005 states that by substituting the parallel component of k
        from the resonance condition into the CPDR, we can obtain a polynomial
        expression for the frequency omega.

        In practice, we have found that this requires some additional work. The CPDR
        is an equation that includes various occurrences of omega in the denominators
        of its many terms (originating from the Stix parameters and mu). Since the
        equation is 'CPDR = 0', we are able to 'multiply out' these omega from the
        denominators to obtain an equation that *is* a polynomial in omega.

        The multiplication factor we use is:

        .. math::
           \omega^6 \prod_s (\omega + \omega_{c,s})(\omega - \omega_{c,s})

        where '\omega_c' is gyrofrequency, and the subscript 's' refers to a
        particular particle.

        This factor has been found by inspection of the CPDR and the Stix terms it is
        comprised of. Multiplying by this results in a polynomial in omega with order
        6 + 2N (for a plasma comprised of N particle species), consistent with Glauert
        and Horne's description.

        # Following multiplication, P becomes a simple quadratic in `w`:

        P = Polynomial([-np.sum(self.__plasma.plasma_freq.value**2), 0, 1])

        # For S, R, and L, the process is more complicated. Following multiplication:
        #
        # - the previously constant '1' term becomes a simple polynomial in `w`,
        # - the summation becomes a summation over a product, where the product skips
        #   the current index of summation (since this is the part that has been
        #   'multiplied out').
        #
        # For example, our new expression for S looks like:

        # run over all particles within the plasma.

        `k_perp` are always positive (we ensure this by taking the absolute value).
